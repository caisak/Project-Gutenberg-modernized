# Project Gutenberg Modernized -[Click here to view in browser](https://caisak.github.io/Project-Gutenberg-modernized/)

## Assignment

This was our second school assignment for the HTML & CSS course. The assignment was to modernize a website that was completely or partially non-responsive. 

Requirements:
* Two HTML files that can be navigated back and forth
* At least two CSS files
* Everythings needs to be responsive and not disappear off-screen
* An icon set must be linked in the head tag and used at least twice
* Animations on both pages
* Bootstrap or Tailwind must be used
* The code needs to be properly structured and commented
* Screen grabs of the original website included in the PowerPoint

Note that this was a group assignment but my partner was sick and couldn't participate as much as planned. My partner did the contact form and footer, the rest is made by me.


## The Project

We chose the website https://www.gutenberg.org/ because it's an amazing resource that could be made more user friendly and modern. The website is difficult to navigate because of the unstructured content. 

The navbar is somewhat responsive - it turns into a dropdown menu for the mobile version. Not everything is responsive though, such as the logo or the book carousel on the home page. 

We took inspiration from websites like https://www.nextory.se/ for the informational pieces on the front page with it's large, colorful graphics. https://www.adlibris.com/se inspired the categorization of products in cards with an icon. 

Both of the websites mentioned above have only been used as "shallow" inspiration in reference to style and categorization. We have not looked at their code in DevTools as the assignment was not to copy their website.


## Limitations
The PowerPoint is in swedish as it was made and presented in a swedish school.

There is no "Contact us" form on the original website. There is a "Contact us" page where the user is encouraged to get in touch by email and a bullet point list of how this is done. We thought this was not user friendly and made a form instead.

The FAQ section is made with an accordion to save space and give the user a quick overview. We selected the first few questions to showcase how the accordion would look and work. Including all the questions would take a lot of unnecessary time and space since the general structure and style repeats.

We chose to make part of the front page but adapted the content to include soulless corporate art and modernized language. "Donate" became "Give Back" for example.

The informational paragraphs on the front page have been reworked to be more short, snappy and readable for the user with a seven second attention span. The "Give Back" section has been given a "Join our Community" as the word and concept of community is popular online.

## Challenges

Using (free, non-licensed) images for the modernized website didn't feel quite right so icons and SVGs were used instead but they have a soulless, impersonal expression which didn't quite fit either. 

My partner originally designed a logo which was an open book with the text "Project Gutenberg" around it. When we tried using it the lines were too thin and the visibility was affected so we chose to use an icon instead.

The SVG in the showcase is kind of off between desktop and mobile. However, it looks fine for the specific break points for different devices.

I couldn't get the accordion to be closed as default. 

I ran the code through the W3C Validation Service and it hates my search button (so do I, but only kind of). I've used a span tag to get it to fit in the navbar and I understand that it may not be correct HTML practice but I couldn't get it to work in any other way.
